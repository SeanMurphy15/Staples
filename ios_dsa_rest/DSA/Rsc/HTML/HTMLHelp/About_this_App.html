  <h1>About this Application
  </h1>
<p class="medium">The Salesforce Services Digital Sales Aid Customer Guide is a  mobile counterpart to your Salesforce.com account.  Digital Sales Aid takes your Salesforce.com  product data and places it in a highly visual, colorful, and easy-to-navigate  mobile format for the Apple iPad tablet.   Sales staff equipped with iPads can now present the most up-to-date  information on your products—such as PDF files, Word documents, PowerPoint  presentations, high-resolution photos, and even videos—directly to customers  when they’re out in the field.   Although data is kept up to date, content can be viewed offline if no Internet connection is available. </p>
  <p class="medium">Digital  Sales Aid is easy to set up by administrators and just involves setting a few options on the Salesforce.com Web site. Users need only log in to the application on their iPad, and their information is automatically transferred from Salesforce.com.</p>
