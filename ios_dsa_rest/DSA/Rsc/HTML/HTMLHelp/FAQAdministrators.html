<h2>Administrators</h2>
<p><span class="xbig">Q:</span> How much effort is required for setup and deployment?<br />
<span class="xbig">A:</span> Setup involves downloading a browser plug-in and setting a few basic options in Salesforce. These include mostly cosmetic items such as background images, which categories to use, and the look &amp; feel of buttons. (Furthermore, Salesforce Services has created a utility to make the process very simple and visual. This utility is automatically installed with the browser plug-in.) </p>
<p>Once the settings have been recorded in Salesforce, field reps need only download the application, and log in--information, including settings, will be transferred automatically. No setup steps are required by the end user.</p>
